This file is created for training purpose!

Adding text to check diff command.

** Project History - 
Locally : we can use "git log". 
Remote : We can go to commits and then select a particular file to check history.

Versioning: Once we commit our changes to the files, that is saved as a version of the repo.

Created New Branch: Named new-feature

** For Exploring history: We can use 
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all
git reflog

** To compare between file:
git diff -- filename[In our case training.txt]

** To compare between branches:
git diff main origin/main

** Delete Unpublished commit:
# git reset --soft commit_id

# git reset --hard commit_id - We can use stash 
Ex: 
1. git stash
2. git reset --hard commit_id
3. git stash pop

** Delete Published commit:
# git revert commit_id
# git revert commit_id1 commit_id2 [For multiple commits]
